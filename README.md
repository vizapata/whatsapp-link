## Frequently Asked Questions

### How about data protection

This plugin just save the WhatsApp number phone in Wordpress Settings. But, when you use this plugin, that number will be visible in all pages. So take care of using a business number phone not your personal one.

### Can I use a different style

The style has no another styling settings. The initial intention is keep it as much simple as posible. If you want to add custom style, feel free to override the default style.
